# Deep Learning Labs and Projects
Hands-on labs and projects exploring deep learning concepts, including neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and transformers, implemented in Python.

This repository contains labs and projects from my Deep Learning course, focusing on the mathematical foundations and practical applications of neural networks. Topics covered include:

- **Introduction to Deep Learning & The Perceptron:** Basics of neural networks and simple classification models.
- **Feature Representation & Margin Maximization:** Understanding how input features affect learning and applying gradient descent for optimization.
- **Regression & Neural Networks:** Implementing linear and nonlinear models for prediction tasks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Image recognition and feature extraction.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTM:** Sequence modeling for text, time series, and other sequential data.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Creating synthetic data and understanding generative models.
- **Attention Mechanisms & Transformers:** Advanced architectures for NLP and sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Basic concepts of agents, rewards, and learning strategies.

Each folder contains:
- Source code and notebooks
- Reports and results
- Instructions for running the projects

**Technologies used:** Python, NumPy
